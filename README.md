# Discourse Skip Moderation

This Discourse plugin lets you specify groups that can avoid moderation on a specified moderated category

The use case is for a collaboration group which works in a semi-open way; they want their work visible, allow only quality external input, and not require approval for their own posts. As the group is quite large it isn't feasible to give them all moderator rights.
